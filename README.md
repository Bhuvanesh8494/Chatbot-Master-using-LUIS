# Digit Recognizer

Predictive machine learning model using SVM classifier to classify the digits from 0-9.

Here we used the famous MNIST dataset.

The MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") dataset is a classic within the Machine Learning community that has been extensively studied.  More detail about the dataset, including Machine Learning algorithms that have been tried on it and their levels of success, can be found at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html.
